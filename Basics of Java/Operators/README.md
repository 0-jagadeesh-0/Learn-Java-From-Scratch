# Java Operators

Java Operators are classified below

- **Arithmetic Operators**
- **Unary Operators**
- **Assignment Operators**
- **Relational Operators**
- **Logical Operators**
- **Ternary Operator**
- **Bitwise Operators**
- **Shift Operators**

### Arithmetic Operators
These operators are used to peform simple arithmetic operations.

- **Addition** - **+**
- **Subtraction** - **-**
- **Multiplication** - <strong>*</strong>
- **Division** - **/**
- **Modulo**  - **%**

### Unary Operators

These are used to increment and decrement a value.

- **Increment operator(++)**
Used to incrementing the value by 1.
   - Post-Increment : Value is first used for computing the result and then incremented.
   - Pre-Increment : Value is incremented first and then result is computed.
- **Decrement operator(--)**
Used to decrementing the value by 1.
   - Post-decrement : Value is first used for computing the result and then decremented.
   - Pre-decrement : Value is decremented first and then result is computed.

- **Logical not operator !**

### Assignment Operator

**=** Assignment operator is used to assign a value to any variable.

- **+=**, for adding left operand with right operand and then assigning it to variable on the left.
- **-=**, for subtracting left operand with right operand and then assigning it to variable on the left.
- ***=**, for multiplying left operand with right operand and then assigning it to variable on the left.
- **/=**, for dividing left operand with right operand and then assigning it to variable on the left.
- **%=**, for assigning modulo of left operand with right operand and then assigning it to variable on the left.

### Relational Operators

- <strong>==</strong> Equal to
- <strong>!=</strong> Not Equal to
- <strong><</strong> Less than
- <strong><=</strong> Less than or equal to
- <strong>></strong> Greater than
- <strong>>=</strong> Greater than or equal to

### Logical Operators

- **&&** Logical AND
- **||** Logical OR

### Ternary Operator

Ternary operator is a shorthand version of if-else statement.

>> **condition ? if true : if false** 

### Bitwise Operators

- **&** Bitwise AND operator
- **|** Bitwise OR operator
- **^** Bitwise XOR operator
- **~** Bitwise Complement operator

### Shift Operators

- **<<**, Left shift operator: shifts the bits of the number to the left and fills 0 on voids left as a result. Similar effect as of multiplying the number with some power of two.
- **>>**, Signed Right shift operator: shifts the bits of the number to the right and fills 0 on voids left as a result. The leftmost bit depends on the sign of initial number. Similar effect as of dividing the number with some power of two.
- **>>>**, Unsigned Right shift operator: shifts the bits of the number to the right and fills 0 on voids left as a result. The leftmost bit is set to 0.
